# expo-permissions

Note: This, `@nativescript-community/expo-permissions`, is simply a minor fork of [`expo-permissions`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-permissions) as a workaround to decouple the Android implementation from React Native. The fork was taken from the state of the `expo` monorepo on commit `ba046bb1946ccc10ded80facdfde4bb67998e9f3` (dated 11th December 2020).

Allows you prompt for various permissions to access device sensors, personal data, etc.
