# @nativescript-community/expo-nativescript

This is a monorepo of various libraries from the [Expo ecosystem](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/), which is primarily a React Native ecosystem, adapted for use with NativeScript. The endgame is for the Expo ecosystem (or at least Expo [Unimodules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9CJZRv7uOY), which are [a large part of it](https://docs.expo.io/bare/unimodules-full-list/)) to be fully supported on NativeScript as it is on React Native. But this is a long way off for now!

It's in proof-of-concept stage right now. Expo <a href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/v39.0.0/sdk/contacts/">Contacts</a> (and Expo <a href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/v39.0.0/sdk/permissions/">Permissions</a>, which it depends upon) is working fully on iOS. Android support is blocked, however ‚Äì [see details](packages/expo-nativescript-adapter/README.md) in the `expo-nativescript-adapter` project.

Please don't look too closely at [apps/demo](apps/demo) and [apps/demo-angular](apps/demo-angular), as I have only been developing with [demo-react](apps/demo-react). They're there only as templates to be filled in properly later.

I hope at some point to simplify this monorepo by removing the packages [@nativescript-community/expo-permissions](packages/expo-permissions) and [@nativescript-community/expo-nativescript-react-native-shim](packages/expo-nativescript-react-native-shim), which only exist to support Android. But for now, we have to put up with them.

And as Android support still isn't working even with best-effort hacks, I'll only be publishing [@nativescript-community/expo-nativescript-adapter](packages/expo-nativescript-adapter), [@nativescript-community/expo-permissions-nativescript-plugin](packages/expo-permissions-nativescript-plugin), and [@nativescript-community/expo-contacts-nativescript-plugin](packages/expo-contacts-nativescript-plugin) to npm for now.

For more information on this project (and particularly if you'd like to help ‚Äì especially so if it's for getting the Android side working), you can contact Jamie Birch on Twitter at [@LinguaBrowse](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=LinguaBrowse), or on the [NativeScript Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T0L97VCSY/CJ2B77CJ1) in the `#react` channel, or on the [NativeScript Discord](https://discord.com/channels/603595811204366337/606457751995940866), again in the `#react` channel.

# What are these packages?

As this project grows, we aim to implement, for each Expo Unimodule such as `expo-contacts`, a corresponding `@nativescript-community/expo-contacts-nativescript-plugin` NativeScript plugin.

# How to operate this monorepo?

This workspace manages the suite of plugins listed above.

In general, when in doubt with what to do, just `npm start`.

## How to add a new package to workspace?

```
npm run add
```

At the prompt, enter the name of the new package.

- This adds a plugin harness in `packages` with the necessary boilerplate to just start developing
- Updates all demo app flavors to support demoing the new package
- Adds shared code in `tools/demo` where you can write demo code **once** and share across all demo flavors
- Updates build tooling to support the new package
- Updates the `npm start` interactive display
- Updates the README here to list the new package

## How to add Angular compatibility to a package

```
npm run add-angular
```

At the prompt, enter the name of the package to add an `angular` folder to it with the necessary boilerplate to provide Angular support to the package.

## How to focus on just 1 package to develop in isolation

```
npm start
```

- Choose the focus commands for the package you wish to focus on and hit enter.
- All the demo app's will be updated to isolate that 1 package and for supported IDE's (currently VS Code), the source code will also become isolated in the workspace.

Note: _good to always clean the demo you plan to run after focusing. (You can clean any demo from `npm start` as well)_

## How to publish packages?

```
npm run publish-packages
```

- You will be prompted for the package names to publish. Leaving blank and hitting enter will publish them all.
- You will then be prompted for the version to use. Leaving blank will auto bump the patch version (it also handles prerelease types like alpha, beta, rc, etc. - It even auto tags the corresponding prelease type on npm).
- You will then be given a brief sanity check üß†üòä

## Why don't we hoist `@nativescript/android` and `@nativescript/ios` in this monorepo?
