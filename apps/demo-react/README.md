# React demo

1. Ensure that you have followed the initial monorepo setup steps (`npm run setup && npm run start` in the root directory of the monorepo).
2. Ensure you [have your environment set up for NativeScript development](https://react-nativescript.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/installation)
3. Run the following command to build (if not yet built) and run the iOS app:

```sh
# Full NativeScript CLI options here: https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/docs-cli/start
ns run ios
```

Android support is incomplete, so the equivalent `ns run android` command won't be of much use right now.
